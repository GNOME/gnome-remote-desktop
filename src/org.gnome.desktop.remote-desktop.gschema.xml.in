      <description>
	The VNC authentication method describes how a remote connection is
	authenticated. It can currently be done in two different ways:

	 * prompt   - by prompting the user for each new connection, requiring a
		      person with physical access to the workstation to
		      explicitly approve the new connection.
	 * password - by requiring the remote client to provide a known password
